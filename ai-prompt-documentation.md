# AI-Assisted Development: Prompt Documentation for Book Library Application

## Executive Summary

This document captures the AI prompts used throughout the development of a full-stack book library application, demonstrating strategic use of AI tools for architecture, implementation, testing, and deployment phases.

## Phase 1: Architecture & Planning

### 1.1 Solution Architecture Design

**Prompt:**
"I'm building a book library application with .NET Core backend and a React, Vite and Typescript frontend. The system needs to support CRUD operations, statistics, and potential scaling to multiple users. Recommend a clean architecture pattern that separates concerns effectively, supports testability, and follows SOLID principles. Include folder structure for both backend and frontend."

### 1.2 Data Modeling & Integration Strategy

**Prompt:**
"Design a scalable database schema for a book library system that starts with a single Book entity but can extend to support user management, favorites, and reading lists. Consider using Domain-Driven Design principles. Show me the entity relationships and explain how to structure this in Entity Framework Core with proper migrations strategy."

### 1.3 API Design Best Practices

**Prompt:**
"Review this Book model and suggest improvements for a RESTful API that follows OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. Include considerations for: versioning strategy, pagination for large datasets, consistent error responses, HATEOAS principles, and proper HTTP status codes. Provide examples of request/response DTOs that separate domain models from API contracts."
